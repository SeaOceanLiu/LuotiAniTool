# LuotiAniTool
LuotiAni is an animation library runs on SDL3, similar to Lottie. It also uses JSON to define animation layers and keyframes, then automatically generates continuous animation frames based on rules during the initialization phase by loading the JSON file. LuotiAniTool is used to generate, play and test whether LuotiAni JSON meets expectations
